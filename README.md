# **Introduction**

The source code in this repo is for the AutoX Watchdog mobile application that interfaces with the hardware unit(https://github.com/Cavan/AutoX_Watchdog_Main_Source).

The application is designed to do the following:

* Allow the user to send commands that will request the hardware unit to capture an image form either the front, left, right, or rear of the unit.
* View received alerts sent by the hardware unit.
* (*Future development*) View the captured image on the user's device, this featured was dropped due to time constraint requirements.
